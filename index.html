I am a PhD candidate at ECE department of Virginia Tech. I work on machine-learning-based intrusion detection and adversarial machine learning. Before I join Virginia Tech, I received my banchelor degree and master degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) in 2015 and 2018 respectively.
